# Installing the application
To install the required dependancies for the application, run the command **yarn run install-server** then **yarn run install-client**. 

# Running the application
To run the application on a local machine, run the command **yarn run dev**. 

### Note on using yarn
If yarn isn't installed on your local machine, replacing yarn scripts with npm will also run the application

# Future Considerations
1. Create additional logic to render the bonus driver based on input changes to the json file.
2. Create additional logic to render completed routes on PlottingChart component.
2. Deploy a build version to a hosted server (Heroku, AWS or similar provider)
3. Utiliize Jest for adding a testing suite
